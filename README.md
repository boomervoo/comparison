The comparison feature has been implemented on the product page (SPA).

#About

Implemented:
— The ability to compare a user-defined number of products. The number of products in the comparison is set by the user.
— When you click on the icon “” next to the image of any of the products, a pop-up appears with the remaining products in the selection.
— Replacement of a product from the selection list. 
— Adding products to the comparison, up to a maximum of 6.
— The “show differences” function, which hides all identical fields for products.
